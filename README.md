#CLOCK TWO
So for those wondering what I could be meaning by clock two, put it simply 20 hours a day, 20 minutes an hour, 216 seconds an hour. Oh and did I mention that the latest and greatest update has a new startup sound? and calender two, which is 12 months, 30 days in a month, with a bonus weekend to end it all off. How to use, well, editing is easy, just open the sln file. The actual program is Clock2/Clock/Clock/bin/Debug/Clock.exe
